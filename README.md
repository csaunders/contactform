## Contact Form

A quick and dirty tool for cheaply hosting contact forms

** What is it? **

Contact Form is a tool that is designed to be hosted on a cheap
hosting service such as heroku for collecting contact form information
from prospective clients or users. It simply allows you to have a contact
form embedded into your application that submits to your Heroku based
app.

With a small amount of configuration you can have an application that will
collect the details your users submit and redirect them to a success or
failure page depending on whether they included the necessary fields.

On failure, the fields that were invalid (empty fields) are included in the
redirect so you can update your form appropriately using Javascript.
